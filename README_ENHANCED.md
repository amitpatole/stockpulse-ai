## How It Works

### News Collection Process

Every 5 minutes, the monitor:
1. Fetches news for each of the 10 stocks
2. Queries all 10+ data sources
3. Processes and deduplicates articles
4. Analyzes sentiment
5. Creates alerts for positive news
6. Updates the dashboard database

### Sentiment Calculation

```
Base Score = (positive_keywords - negative_keywords) / total_keywords

If engagement > 100: score *= 1.1
If engagement > 500: score *= 1.2

Final Score is clamped to [-1, 1]

Positive: score > 0.3
Negative: score < -0.3
Neutral: -0.3 <= score <= 0.3
```

### Alert Criteria

An alert is created when:
- Sentiment label is 'positive'
- Sentiment score > 0.3
- Article is not a duplicate

### Trump Monitoring

Trump monitoring uses 3 methods:
1. **Direct news search** - "Trump + [ticker]" on Google News
2. **Truth Social scraping** - Attempts to fetch from @realDonaldTrump
3. **Policy news** - Trump + tariff/trade/policy + ticker

Articles prefixed with `[TRUMP]`, `[TRUMP TRUTH SOCIAL]`, or `[TRUMP POLICY]` for easy identification.

## Configuration

### Change Check Interval

Edit `stock_monitor_enhanced.py`:
```python
CHECK_INTERVAL = 300  # seconds (default: 5 minutes)
```

### Modify Monitored Stocks

Edit `stock_monitor_enhanced.py`:
```python
STOCKS = ['GTI', 'APLD', 'INTC', ...]
```

### Adjust Reddit Subreddits

Edit `stock_monitor_enhanced.py`:
```python
REDDIT_SUBREDDITS = ['wallstreetbets', 'stocks', ...]
```

### Fine-tune Sentiment Keywords

Edit the keyword lists in `stock_monitor_enhanced.py`:
```python
POSITIVE_KEYWORDS = [...]
NEGATIVE_KEYWORDS = [...]
```

### Change Dashboard Port

Edit `dashboard.py`:
```python
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000, debug=False)
```

## Database Schema

SQLite database: `stock_news.db`

### Tables

**news**
- id, ticker, title, description, url (unique)
- source, published_date
- sentiment_score, sentiment_label
- engagement_score
- created_at

**alerts**
- id, ticker, news_id (foreign key)
- alert_type, message
- created_at

**monitor_status**
- id (always 1), last_check, status, message

### Indexes
- idx_ticker - Fast ticker lookups
- idx_created_at - Fast date range queries
- idx_sentiment - Fast sentiment filtering

## Advanced Usage

### Query Database Directly

```bash
# View all positive alerts
sqlite3 stock_news.db "SELECT ticker, title, sentiment_score FROM news WHERE sentiment_label='positive' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;"

# Count articles by source
sqlite3 stock_news.db "SELECT source, COUNT(*) as count FROM news GROUP BY source ORDER BY count DESC;"

# View Trump-related news
sqlite3 stock_news.db "SELECT ticker, title, source FROM news WHERE source LIKE '%Trump%' ORDER BY created_at DESC;"

# Articles with high engagement
sqlite3 stock_news.db "SELECT ticker, title, engagement_score FROM news WHERE engagement_score > 100 ORDER BY engagement_score DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

### Reddit Configuration (Optional)

For better Reddit access, get API credentials:
1. Go to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps
2. Create an app (script type)
3. Update `stock_monitor_enhanced.py`:
```python
self.reddit = praw.Reddit(
    client_id='YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
    client_secret='YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET',
    user_agent=USER_AGENT,
)
```

Without credentials, Reddit monitoring may be limited but will still work in read-only mode.

### Running as System Service

Create `/etc/systemd/system/stock-monitor.service`:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Enhanced Stock News Monitor
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=your_username
WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/marketwatch
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 stock_monitor_enhanced.py
Restart=always
RestartSec=60

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Create `/etc/systemd/system/stock-dashboard.service`:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Stock Monitor Dashboard
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=your_username
WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/marketwatch
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 dashboard.py
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable and start:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable stock-monitor stock-dashboard
sudo systemctl start stock-monitor stock-dashboard
```

## Troubleshooting

### No news appearing
- Check internet connection
- Verify monitor.log for errors
- Some sources may be rate-limited (this is normal)
- Reddit requires PRAW library

### Dashboard not loading
- Ensure port 5000 is not in use: `lsof -i :5000`
- Check dashboard.log for errors
- Verify Flask is installed: `pip show flask`

### No alerts showing
- Alerts only appear for positive news
- Wait 5 minutes for first check cycle
- Check if any stocks have positive news in monitor.log

### Reddit not working
- Reddit can work without API keys in limited mode
- For full access, configure PRAW credentials
- Check if subreddits are accessible

### Twitter/Nitter not working
- Nitter instances can be unreliable
- The monitor tries 3 different instances
- Twitter monitoring is bonus; other sources will still work

### Trump monitoring not getting results
- Truth Social may block scraping attempts
- Google News searches for Trump mentions still work
- This is a best-effort feature

## Performance

- **Check interval**: 5 minutes per cycle
- **Sources per stock**: 10+ sources
- **Total queries**: 100+ per cycle (10 stocks Ã— 10 sources)
- **Database size**: ~1MB per 1000 articles
- **Memory usage**: ~100-200MB
- **CPU usage**: Low, spikes during check cycles

## Privacy & Rate Limiting

- All scraping respects robots.txt
- User-Agent identifies as standard browser
- Delays between requests prevent rate limiting
- No authentication required for most sources
- Read-only access to all sources
