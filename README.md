### AI Provider Configuration

‚ö†Ô∏è **SECURITY WARNING - READ CAREFULLY** ‚ö†Ô∏è

StockPulse AI supports real AI integration with OpenAI (ChatGPT), Anthropic (Claude), Google (Gemini), and xAI (Grok) for enhanced stock analysis.

**IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTICE:**
- **API keys are stored in PLAIN TEXT in the local SQLite database**
- This application is designed for **SELF-HOSTED, PERSONAL USE ONLY**
- **DO NOT expose this dashboard to the public internet**
- **DO NOT share your database file** (`stock_news.db`)
- **YOU are responsible for the security of your API keys**
- Use only on localhost or secure private networks
- Consider using API key restrictions/limits on the provider's side

**Setting up AI Providers:**

1. **Go to Settings Tab** in the dashboard (‚öôÔ∏è Settings)

2. **Get your API key** from one of these providers:
   - **OpenAI**: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - **Anthropic**: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
   - **Google**: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
   - **xAI (Grok)**: https://console.x.ai

3. **Configure in Dashboard:**
   - Select your AI provider
   - Choose the model (e.g., gpt-4, claude-3-5-sonnet, gemini-pro)
   - Enter your API key
   - Click "Test Connection" to verify
   - Click "Save & Activate" to enable

4. **AI Features** (when configured):
   - Enhanced sentiment analysis with real AI
   - Natural language stock analysis and recommendations
   - Intelligent news summarization
   - Context-aware market insights

**Supported Models:**
- **OpenAI**: GPT-4o (recommended), GPT-4o Mini, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4, GPT-3.5 Turbo

**Cost Considerations:**
- AI providers charge per API call
- Monitor your usage on the provider's dashboard
- Set up billing alerts to avoid unexpected charges
- The system works without AI configuration (uses technical analysis only)

### Reddit Configuration (Optional)
To enable full Reddit access, get API credentials from https://reddit.com/prefs/apps and update `stock_monitor_enhanced.py`:
```python
self.reddit = praw.Reddit(
    client_id='your_client_id',
    client_secret='your_client_secret',
    user_agent='StockPulse AI v1.0'
)
```
